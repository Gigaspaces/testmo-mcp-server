# Testmo MCP Server — Test Plan

Manual test plan for validating the testmo MCP server. Each test case includes a ready-to-paste prompt. Run these in a Claude Code session with the testmo MCP active.

---

## Environment Setup

Before running tests, verify the MCP is loaded:

```
/mcp
```

Expected: `testmo` listed as connected with 32 tools.

**Variables used in prompts** — replace with real values from your instance:
- `PROJECT_ID` — use a real project ID (run smoke test TC-001 first to get one)
- `FOLDER_ID` — a folder that exists in your project
- `CASE_ID` — a test case that exists in your project
- `RUN_ID` — an automation run that exists

---

## Model Recommendations

| Model | Suitable for |
|---|---|
| **Haiku** | Smoke tests, single read operations (TC-001–TC-010) |
| **Sonnet** | All functional tests, pagination, filtering |
| **Opus** | Multi-step scenarios, chained operations (Suite 9) |

---

## Suite 1 — Smoke Tests

Quick validation that the MCP connects and core read operations work. Run these first.

---

### TC-001 · List Projects · Smoke · Any model

**Prompt:**
```
Use the testmo MCP to list all available projects. Show me the project IDs and names in a table.
```

**Expected:**
- Returns a list of projects with `id` and `name`
- No error, `isError` not present in response
- stderr shows `[testmo] list_projects called` and `[testmo] list_projects ok (Xms)`

---

### TC-002 · Authenticated User · Smoke · Any model

**Prompt:**
```
Using the testmo MCP, tell me who is currently authenticated — show the user's name, email, and role.
```

**Expected:**
- Returns user object with `name`, `email`
- Confirms the `TESTMO_ACCESS_TOKEN` is valid

---

### TC-003 · List Users · Smoke · Any model

**Prompt:**
```
Use the testmo MCP to list users in the workspace. Show up to 10 results.
```

**Expected:**
- Returns paginated list of users
- `page` and `limit` params respected

---

## Suite 2 — Projects

---

### TC-010 · Get Project by ID · Positive · Haiku

```

**Expected:**
- Tool returns `isError: true`
- Error message contains `404` or `not found`
- Server does NOT crash — `withErrorRecovery` catches the error

Use the testmo MCP to:
1. Create 2 test cases in project [PROJECT_ID]: "[TEST] Case A" and "[TEST] Case B"
2. Get their IDs
3. Update both cases at once to set priority to 1 (critical) using update_cases
4. Verify the update by fetching each case
5. Delete both cases to clean up
```

**Expected:**

- `custom_priority: 1` on both cases after update

---

### TC-036 · Create Case with Invalid Priority · Negative · Haiku

**Prompt:**

- Both return consistent user data

---

### TC-071 · List Groups and Roles · Positive · Haiku

**Prompt:**
```
Use the testmo MCP to list all user groups and all user roles in the workspace. Present them in two separate tables.

---

## Suite 9 — Error Handling & Edge Cases

---

### TC-080 · Error Recovery — Invalid Token · Negative · Any model

> **Setup:** Temporarily set `TESTMO_ACCESS_TOKEN=invalid` in Claude settings and restart.

**Prompt:**
```
Use the testmo MCP to list projects.
```

**Expected:**
- Env validation catches invalid token (length < 10) and server refuses to start
- OR if token passes length check: API returns 401, `withErrorRecovery` returns `isError: true`

---

### TC-081 · Error Recovery — Network Timeout · Negative · Any model

> **This test is conceptual** — trigger by pointing `TESTMO_BASE_URL` at a non-responding host.

**Prompt:**
```
Use the testmo MCP to list all projects.
```

**Expected:**
- After 30 seconds, `AbortSignal.timeout` fires
- `withErrorRecovery` catches the `TimeoutError`
- Returns `isError: true` with message about timeout
- Server remains running — other tools still work after

---

### TC-082 · Pagination Boundary · Edge · Sonnet

**Prompt:**
```
Use the testmo MCP to list test cases in project [PROJECT_ID] with limit=1, page=1. Then page=2. Then page=9999. What does the last page return?
```

**Expected:**
- Pages 1 and 2 return results (if enough cases exist)
- Page 9999 returns empty data array — NOT an error
- Server handles empty response gracefully

---

### TC-083 · Bulk Operation at Limit · Edge · Sonnet

**Prompt:**
```
Ask the testmo MCP to delete 101 case IDs at once (use IDs 1 through 101). What happens?
```

**Expected:**
- Zod validation rejects the input: `case_ids` array exceeds `max(100)`
- Error returned before any API call

---

### TC-084 · Empty inputSchema Tools · Positive · Haiku

**Prompt:**
```
Using the testmo MCP, call list_projects, list_groups, and list_roles — all three in a single response without me asking separately.
```

**Expected:**
- Model calls all three tools that have empty `inputSchema: {}`
- No TypeScript errors from the `withErrorRecovery` generic wrapper
- All three return results

---

### TC-085 · Concurrent Tool Calls · Positive · Sonnet

**Prompt:**
```
Use the testmo MCP to simultaneously fetch: the current user, the list of projects, and the list of roles. Run all three in parallel and combine the results into a summary.
```

**Expected:**
- Model makes 3 parallel tool calls in one turn
- All three return results
- No race conditions or shared-state errors

---

## Suite 10 — Multi-Step Scenarios (Opus / Sonnet)

End-to-end workflows that simulate real QA usage.

---

### TC-090 · Full Test Case Lifecycle · E2E · Opus

**Prompt:**
```
Using the testmo MCP, walk me through a complete test case lifecycle in project [PROJECT_ID]:

1. Create a folder named "[TEST SUITE] Login Feature"
2. Create 3 test cases in that folder:
   - "Verify login with valid credentials" (priority: 2, steps: navigate → enter creds → verify dashboard)
   - "Verify login with wrong password" (priority: 1, steps: navigate → enter wrong creds → verify error message)
   - "Verify login form validation" (priority: 3, steps: submit empty form → verify field errors)
3. Update all 3 cases to add custom_preconditions: "Application is deployed and accessible"
4. Show a summary table of the created cases
5. Clean up: delete all 3 cases and the folder
```

**Expected:**
- All operations succeed in sequence
- Model correctly chains IDs from create responses into subsequent calls
- Final cleanup leaves no test data

---

### TC-091 · CI Run Simulation · E2E · Sonnet

**Prompt:**
```
Simulate a CI test run using the testmo MCP for project [PROJECT_ID]:

1. Create a new automation run named "[TEST] Simulated CI — $(today's date)"
2. Create a thread named "API Tests"
3. Append an artifact: name="test-report.html", url="https://example.com/report"
4. Append a link: name="Pull Request", url="https://github.com"
5. Complete the run
6. Immediately fetch the run results (expect empty for a fresh run — that's fine)
7. Show a summary of what was created
```

**Expected:**
- Realistic CI workflow modeled correctly
- `append_to_run` handles both artifacts and links in one call
- Completed run visible in `list_runs` with status 1

---

### TC-092 · Cross-Resource Query · E2E · Sonnet

**Prompt:**
```
Using the testmo MCP, answer these questions about project [PROJECT_ID]:
1. How many test cases are there in total? (use pagination if needed)
2. How many are in the top-level folders vs. nested folders?
3. Who are the workspace members? (list users)
4. Are there any open automation runs?

Present the findings as a structured report.
```

**Expected:**
- Model correctly uses `list_cases`, `list_folders`, `list_users`, `list_runs` with filters
- Understands pagination — fetches multiple pages if total > limit
- Synthesizes data from multiple tools into a coherent report

---

## Checklist — Post-Deployment Regression

Run after any change to `src/`:

- [ ] TC-001 (list_projects) — basic connectivity
- [ ] TC-002 (get_current_user) — auth works
- [ ] TC-011 (get non-existent project) — `withErrorRecovery` active
- [ ] TC-033 (create minimal case) + delete — write path works
- [ ] TC-022 (create + delete folder) — destructive tool works
- [ ] TC-083 (bulk limit validation) — Zod schemas enforced
- [ ] TC-052 (create + complete run) — automation run flow works

---

## Notes

- All `[TEST]` prefixed resources created during testing should be deleted in the same session.
- If a test fails midway and leaves orphaned data, search by name prefix `[TEST]` in the Testmo UI.
- stderr output from `withErrorRecovery` is visible in the Claude Code MCP log — check it when a tool behaves unexpectedly.
- The `delete_*` tools carry `destructiveHint: true` — Claude may ask for confirmation before executing them.
